Goals:
Work Norms:
-	Definition of done: Passing unit and acceptance tests for given story, and everyone has approved the pull requests.
Ground Rules: 
  1. Its okay to miss one or two meetings with a valid excuse, if a memeber misses more than that, absences will be documented and could be grounds for discipline.
  2. Weekly scrum meetings should roughly be 15 mins and should be logged.
  3. Be nice and respectful.
  4. Minimum three group members must respond to pull requests within 24 hours, if this is not happening, discuss in Scrum Meeting
  5. There will be a group chat with all team members in Teams.
  6. If someone says they are struggling in the group chat, other team members should reach out to offer help.
